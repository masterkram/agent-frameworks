  <span slot="description">Over the past 3 years several AI agent frameworks have been created, as can be seen here.
  The goal of these frameworks is to help developers **create LLM based programs that consistently
  finish business tasks successfully**.<br />

{/* ## What is an AI Agent ?
Based on reviewing all the frameworks above and this blog post. I came up with my own definition.
My problem is that everyone seems to come up with explanations for developers. But this does not help
when selling to non technical companies. This is how I would explain it to non techical people while keeping the definition technically sound.

An AI agent is:
> A computer program based on AI which executes a task

example tasks could be:
+ giving a spoken weather report.
+ updating a kanban board based on customer feedback.
+ making graphs.

What does this definiton mean in technical detail:

+ A large language model is given a level of authority to make decisions.
  + technically speaking, control flow is determined fully or in part by the output of a model.
