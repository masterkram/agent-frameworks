## About

Since 2024 **agents** have been a hot topic in AI.

The term agent itself is not well defined and most people don't know exactly what it is.

I built this site because I was struggling to follow all the different frameworks that were emerging and to understand the differences between them.

That is why I created codeagents.dev as a directory of all AI agent frameworks that I am aware of.
Instead of just putting the links to the frameworks, I wrote two agents for each framework.

This allowed me to dive deeper into the different frameworks and understand if they are actually useful.

This site was built as a reference to compare the different approaches to building AI agents.

## Frequently Asked Questions

> What is an agent?

An AI agent is a software program that is able to finish tasks for a user.
The agent has control over the flow of the code. It can decide when to stop when it has finished the task.
Additionally, the agent has access to tools that can be used to complete the task.

> Why are there so many frameworks?

From reviewing all the frameworks, many of them are companies and startups trying to acquire users that can be later converted into paying customers of a cloud service.
This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is something to be aware of. This motivates many companies to build a framework and be ready to expand into this market.

> What is the difference between an agent and a model in a for loop?

A model call in a for loop is not an agent, because an agent can control the flow.
It can decide when to stop the loop, when it decides that it has finished the task.
Additionally, the AI agent has access to tools that can be used to complete the task.

> Isn't an agent is just a cron job with an LLM call?

A cron job is just a way to schedule a task to run at a specific time. It can be a great way to run an agent.
However the cron job combined with an LLM call is not an agent by itself.
For this to be an agent, it needs to be able to control the flow of the task.

> Is it better to just maintain these abstractions myself?

Sometimes it may be better to write the equivalent code of the framework yourself.
This website can help to be a reference to compare the different approaches to building AI agents.
